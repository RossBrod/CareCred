# MVP and Phased Implementation Analysis

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

### Core Features
- **Basic User Registration**: Simple sign-up with email verification for students and seniors
- **Manual Profile Setup**: Basic bio, photo, and availability calendar without complex matching preferences
- **Simple Matching System**: Admin-facilitated matching based on location and availability only
- **GPS Check-in/Check-out**: Core location verification for session attendance
- **Blockchain Integration**: Immutable session logging on public blockchain
- **Session Confirmation**: Both parties confirm session completion
- **Basic Credit Tracking**: Simple hour-to-credit conversion
- **In-app Messaging**: Basic communication between matched users


### User Journey Simplification
- **Students**: Register → Admin approval → Create basic profile → Get matched by admin → Complete sessions → Earn credits

- **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization features
- **Gamification Elements**: Achievement badges and leaderboards

## Rationale

The MVP focuses on proving the core value proposition: connecting students with seniors for time-based credit exchange. By starting with manual processes (admin-facilitated matching, manual credit approval), we can validate market demand while minimizing technical complexity and development time.

This phased approach allows for:
- **Faster time-to-market** with essential features only
- **Lower initial development costs** by avoiding complex integrations
- **User feedback incorporation** before building advanced features
- **Proof of concept validation** before significant blockchain investment
- **Iterative improvement** based on real usage data

The MVP maintains the core safety features (GPS verification, admin oversight) while deferring nice-to-have automation until market validation is achieved.
