## Conclusion

This gap analysis reveals significant specification gaps that must be addressed before development begins. Priority should be given to technical infrastructure gaps (database, authentication, GPS security) and core business logic (session management, rating systems, dispute resolution) to ensure a solid foundation for the CareCred platform.

The identified questions require stakeholder input from business owners, technical architects, and compliance teams to ensure comprehensive requirement coverage and successful implementation.
